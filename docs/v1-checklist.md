# Falcon 1.0 checklist

Every rule row below must be resolved before falcon 1.0; there is no post-1.0 tier. A rule row is deleted once it ships. The declarations in `crates/falcon_rules/src/lint/<group>.rs` and `crates/falcon_rules/src/cross_file.rs` are authoritative for shipped rule ids, groups, domains, execution kinds, and default enablement.

## Legend

**Falcon groups** are `a11y | complexity | correctness | performance | security |
style | suspicious`.

**Analysis types** (what a rule needs from the engine):

- **syntax-only**: syntax-tree pass, no types.
- **needs-local-type-inference**: local flow/types.
- **needs-full-type-resolution**: element model / SDK type hierarchies.
- **needs-cross-file/project**: whole-program or pubspec/asset analysis.

## Rule totals

| Source | remaining |
|---|---:|
| Cross-file additions | 8 |
| Additional rules | 3 |
| **Total** | **11** |

Counts reflect remaining checklist rows.

Additional rules are planned rows from outside the DCM catalog; their paywall column reads `n/a`. Requirements folded into existing rows are not counted again.

## Remaining additional rules (3)

These rules come from outside the DCM catalog.

| rule | falcon group | analysis | paywall | description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `avoid-non-ascii-symbols` | style | S | n/a | Opt-in warning for non-ASCII symbols. |
| `allow-top-level-test-helpers` | suspicious | S | n/a | Opt-in convention check for top-level helpers in test files. |
| `prefer-async-value-when` | style | LT | n/a | Optional style preference for AsyncValue.when. |

## Planned cross-file rules (8)

Whole-project / app-wide rules live in the `cross-file` config section.
Difficulty reflects existing infrastructure: **A** reuses the resolved directive
graph / lexical name index; **B** needs a new pubspec index
(`dependencies`/`dev_dependencies`/`flutter.assets`); **C** needs a new
asset/l10n index (filesystem walk and/or `.arb` parsing).

| rule | falcon group | analysis | difficulty | description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `unused-assets` | correctness | needs-cross-file/project | C | Asset declared in pubspec `flutter: assets:` but no string literal references its path. |
| `unused-l10n` | correctness | needs-cross-file/project | C | Generated localization key (`.arb`) never referenced through the generated accessor. |
| `architecture-layer-boundaries` | correctness | needs-cross-file/project | A | Warn when imports cross clean-architecture or feature-first layers classified heuristically by path. |
| `unexported-public-api` | style | needs-cross-file/project | A | Public declaration used across the package but never surfaced through a barrel/public library. |
| `missing-assets` | suspicious | needs-cross-file/project | C | String literal that looks like an asset path (`assets/…`) not declared in pubspec. |
| `unused-dev-dependencies` | correctness | needs-cross-file/project | B | Dev-dependency imported nowhere under `test/`, `tool/`, `integration_test/`. |
| `no-deep-package-imports` | correctness | needs-cross-file/project | A | Importing another package's internal file past its public barrel. |
| `duplicate-barrel-exports` | suspicious | needs-cross-file/project | A | Same symbol re-exported by two barrels → ambiguous import. |
